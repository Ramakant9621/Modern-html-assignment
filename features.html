<h3>Multimedia Support:</h3>

<h3>Local Storage:</h3>

The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs provide a way to store key-value pairs locally on the client side, allowing for persistent data storage.
<h3>Offline Web Applications:
</h3>
<p>The Application Cache (AppCache) allows web developers to create web applications that can be accessed offline.


Web Workers allow for parallel execution of scripts in the background, improving performance by offloading tasks from the main thread.

HTML5 supports the creation of responsive web designs through features like media queries, allowing developers to adapt layouts based on the device's screen size.



HTML5 introduces native support for drag-and-drop functionality, making it easier to implement intuitive user interfaces.
Accessibility Improvements:

New attributes and features contribute to better accessibility, including the alt attribute for area> elements, the figcaption> element for figure>, and the details> and summary> elements.


Improved security features such as the sandbox> attribute for iframes, which provides a restricted environment for executing scripts.
These features collectively enhance the capabilities of web development, enabling richer and more interactive web applications. Keep in mind that browser support for these features may vary, and developers should consider using feature detection or polyfills for better compatibility.
