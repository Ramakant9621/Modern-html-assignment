    <h3>list any three ways which helps us in improving the accessibility in html</h3>

    <p>Utilize semantic HTML elements to provide meaningful structure to your content. Semantically appropriate elements, such as header>, nav>, main>, article>, section>, footer>, etc., help screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the organization of content. This improves navigation and comprehension for users with disabilities.</p>
    <h5>example</h5>
    <header>
        <h1>Page Title</h1>
    </header>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    <main>
        <!-- Main content goes here -->
    </main>
    <footer>
        <!-- Footer content goes here -->
    </footer>

    <p>nclude descriptive alternative text for images using the alt attribute. This is essential for users with visual impairments who may rely on screen readers. The alternative text should convey the purpose or content of the image, ensuring that users can understand the information even if they cannot see the visual content.</p>
    <h5>example</h5>

    <img src="example.jpg" alt="A beautiful landscape with mountains and a lake">

    <p>Ensure that all interactive elements on your webpage can be accessed and operated using a keyboard. This is crucial for users with mobility impairments who may rely on keyboards or other input devices. Test your website's navigation and functionality using only the keyboard to make sure it's accessible.</p>
       <h5> Example:</h5>
       <button onclick="myFunction()">Click me</button>

    
    
    
    
</body>
